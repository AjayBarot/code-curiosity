# Code Curiosity 

This is a coding contest which pushes developers to contribute back to open-source while improving their quality of code, their coding practices, improving team work and learning from others. 

### Rules of Engagement: 

* All developers have to participate and be a part of a team that has exactly 3 members.
* The team must collectively choose to build or contribute to an open source  library, gem, or plugin. No Rails or Andriod applications or ideas will be permitted. This is not a contest where we see what you build and how fast but how you contribute to open source and improve your skills.
* You can contribute to any open source language libraries or the languages themselves - Ruby, Javascript, Android, iOS, Go or anything else.
* The team needs to make a 5 minute presentation of what they are going to work on before starting work.

### Judges and scoring.

* Juding is monthly with prizes for the leading team.
* Judging will be based on number of commits, quality of commits, quality of code, test coverage, the thought process etc. 
* Judging will in 2 phases. Individual judgement based on criteria that gets us a percentile. 2nd phase is an internal  judges panel discussion to decide the winning team.
* It is in your interest to ensure that at least 1 or 2 of the judges know details of what you are doing. This will also help you to ensure that you are following best practices. 

### Duration

* This is an an on-going monthly contest with prizes (and penalties) every month! 
* Every 3 months, the teams will be shuffled by judges to ensure better participation and interaction.
* Every 3 months, every dev needs to pick up something new with a new team. Only under exceptional cases, will some people be allowed to continue their existing open source contribution. 

### What is this repository? 

This is the dashboard that will show the current team standings.
Teams of 3 will be Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, ...

Repositories will be forked in this account and code commited there, so that this dashboard can monitor commits. The dashboard will show statistical data of commits of all team members. This is not a rule for judging but gives a good idea of the competitiveness between the team. 

Let the games begin.
