    question: What is Code Curiosity?
    answer: Code Curiosity is a platform that encourages contribution to open source. Everyone is rewarded for their efforts, however big or small. This is not a "winner takes all" competition. Code Curiosity rewards code commits, opening or commenting on issues and even consistency in open-source contribution. In short, we create a healthy competition among contributors and gives them the incentive to contribute. Our aim is to make open-source contribution a habit!

    question: Who should use Code Curiosity?
    answer: Everyone who contributes to open source. It's not only fun but you're also making a difference! Since all commits are rewarded and everyone (experts and newbies alike) is rewarded, it's always encouraging. There are so many repository owners that are looking out for help from developers and Code Curiosity not only helps you help others but also rewards you while doing it. It's about having your cake and eating it too!.

    question: How does it work?
    answer: We gamify open-source contributions. Everyone is rewarded and everything is rewarded. We level the playing field by ensuring that you compete in a group that has a profile similar to yours. When you add a repository to Code Curiosity, we start analysing your commits and other activity. They are automatically scored and shown on your dashboard. Every month-end, the cumulative scores are added to your wallet and monthly winners declared.

    question: How do I signup?
    answer: You can signup using your github account and it's free.
  -
    question: Why only Github? Why not BitBucket or GitLab or any other open-source systems?
    answer: We believe that Github is the center of the universe and we do hope Github shows us the same love back! :) Having said that, we believe that most of the open-source contributions happen on Github and it helps to take baby steps. If we see a definite need to integrate with others, we shall do that in the far future!
  -
    question: Can I add any repository?
    answer: No. It's important that we stick to "valuable contributions". You are *not* rewarded for adding commits to your test repository! You will be able to see only those repositories that have more than 25 stars or whose origin (i.e. from where your forked it) has 25 stars.
  -
    question: Why aren't all my repositories or forked repositories showing up?
    answer: There could be couple of reasons, 1. The origin repository of your forked repository may not have sufficient stars or 2. It is syncing in the background and may take sometime to reflect.
  -
    question: How are past contributions rewarded?
    answer: When a user signs up, Code Curiosity profiles the user's and the user's owned repositories. For every repository that has more than 25 stars, a royalty bonus is credited based on a factor of number of stars and number of followers. Organization contributions are not counted (yet) and commits as collaborator to another repository is not counted.
  -
    question: How is the scoring done?
    answer: The scoring is done automatically using an algorithm based on criteria: is the commit in the ciritical path, does it fix an issue, the number of lines commited, the expertize of the user etc. This is always evolving and ideas are welcome. These scores can be over-ridden by langauge or domain experts as and when required.
  -
    question: When is the scoring done?
    answer: Scoring is done continuously but the results may take some time to show. Every month-end, your wallet gets credited with the cumulative scores. If you are among that month's winners, you get more points credited to your wallet!
  -
    question: What all is scored?
    answer: Automated scoring is done on commits, comments, opening an issue and closing an issue today. As we evolve, this may get more streamlined and we may include other factors too.
  -
    question:  How do I redeem my points?
    answer: Redemptions are in the form of digital prizes or Github Merchandize or Company sponsored swag. You need to accumulate at least 1500 points, you can redeem them.
  -
    question: Can I make real money from Code Curiosity?
    answer: Not yet ;) It is our aim to sort out legal issues and if we get enough grants and contributions from the community, we would be more than happy to reward open-source contributions with money. We dream to invent a new career - A full-time open source contributor who works for the community and not for a company!
  -
    question: How does Code Curiosity sustain? What keeps is it going?
    answer: Currently, we at Josh Software, keep it going. We would love to get some support from companies who support this cause. We would love to have companies like Github, Mozzilla and others provide us grants to take this initiative to greater heights. What is critical is that grants are for ALL open-source repositories equally - we do not believe in grants for specific repositories and we shall never allow that!
  -
    question: Do companies or organisations benefit from Code Curiosity?
    answer: Yes. We are in the process of giving a cumulative score to organisations that the github users belongs to. So, if you are working in a company that enourages you to contribute to open-source, the organization overall rating increases too! This is an algorithm that uses a weighted average of it's employees scores. This not only helps the organization get a better profile but also encourages developers to join such companies!
